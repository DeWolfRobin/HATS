# H.A.T.S. (Hub for Amazing TF2 Stuff)

Welcome to **H.A.T.S. (Hub for Amazing TF2 Stuff)!** With the release of Team Fortress 2's client and server source code in the latest SDK update, this repository serves as a central hub for tracking and showcasing community projects utilizing the newly available resources.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
This repository is a collaborative effort to document and highlight projects that build upon or modify the TF2 open-source code. Whether it's new game modes, tools, mods, or enhancements, we want to keep track of all the creative endeavors happening in the community.

## ðŸ“œ How It Works
We use the **GitHub Wiki** to list and track community projects. Each project gets its own page with details about its purpose, progress, contributors, and links to relevant resources. Additionally, we maintain a community-driven **Discord server** where developers and fans can collaborate, discuss ideas, and share updates in real time.
